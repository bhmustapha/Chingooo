    <h1>Chingooo Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 16, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Chingooo, a carpooling application developed as a graduation project designed to connect drivers and riders for convenient and shared journeys. This Privacy Policy outlines how Chingooo collects, uses, shares, and protects your personal information. By downloading, installing, or using the Chingooo mobile application ("the App"), you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Chingooo Collects</h2>
    <h3>Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your name, email address, phone number, password, and optionally a profile picture.</li>
        <li><strong>Driver Information:</strong> If you register as a driver, we collect details about your vehicle (make, model, license plate, color) and your driver's license details (for verification purposes).</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If Chingooo facilitates payments (e.g., through a third-party payment gateway), we collect payment method details (e.g., credit card number, expiry date). Please note: We do not store full credit card numbers directly on our servers; these are handled securely by our trusted third-party payment processor.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Messages you send to other users within the App or to Chingooo support.</li>
        <li><strong>Saved Locations:</strong> Locations you choose to save as "Home," "Work," or "Favorites" for quicker access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Chingooo Collects Automatically (Usage Data):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect precise or approximate location data from your mobile device when the App is running in the foreground (App open and on-screen) or background (App open but not on-screen). This data is essential for facilitating ride matching, real-time navigation, and for showing your current location to your ride partner.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Your device's IP address, unique device identifiers, operating system, mobile network information, and crash data.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> How you interact with Chingooo, including features accessed, screens viewed, and search queries. This helps us understand user behavior and improve the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies or similar technologies for analytics, authentication, and to enhance your user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information from Third Parties:</h3>
    <p>If you use third-party services integrated within Chingooo (e.g., Google Maps for navigation, Firebase for analytics, a payment gateway for transactions), these services may also collect data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their respective policies.</p>

    <h2>3. How Chingooo Uses Your Information</h2>
    <p>Chingooo uses the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Connecting Drivers and Riders:</strong> To effectively match you with suitable carpools, display your location to your ride partner, and provide seamless navigation instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> To create and manage your user account, verify your identity, and enable secure login.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing Payments:</strong> To facilitate secure transactions between drivers and riders (if payment features are implemented in the App).</li>
        <li><strong>Improving Chingooo:</strong> To analyze usage patterns, identify and fix bugs, develop new features, and enhance the overall user experience of the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> To ensure the safety of all users, prevent fraudulent activities, investigate incidents during rides, and respond to potential security threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you ride confirmations, status updates, support messages, and important announcements about Chingooo.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> To provide assistance and resolve any issues or inquiries you may have.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> To comply with legal obligations, enforce our Terms and Conditions, and respond to lawful requests from authorities in Algeria.</li>
        <li><strong>For Our Graduation Project:</strong> As this is a graduation project, anonymized and aggregated data (data that cannot directly identify you) might be used for academic reporting, research, and presentation purposes. Your individual personal information will not be shared publicly as part of the project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How Chingooo Shares Your Information</h2>
    <p>We share your information to make the carpooling service work effectively and for other legitimate purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Other Users:</strong> When you are matched for a ride, your name, profile picture, approximate pickup/drop-off locations, and vehicle details (for drivers) will be shared with your designated ride partner to facilitate the journey. Any messages sent through the in-app chat are shared between the sender and receiver.</li>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We collaborate with third-party vendors to support the operation of Chingooo, such as cloud hosting services, analytics providers (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics), and potentially payment processors. These providers are only granted access to the data necessary to perform their specific services on our behalf and are obligated to protect your information.</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, court order, or governmental requests, or when we believe such action is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public in Algeria.</li>
        <li><strong>For Academic Purposes:</strong> As mentioned, anonymized and aggregated data may be used for academic reporting and presentation of the graduation project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update most of your profile information directly within the Chingooo App settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Permissions:</strong> You can manage Chingooo's access to your location services through your mobile device settings at any time. Please note that disabling location services may significantly impact the App's core carpooling functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can request to delete your Chingooo account through the App settings or by contacting our support team at [Your Project Email Address]. Upon deletion, we will remove your personal data from our active databases, though some anonymized data may be retained for analytical purposes or as required by law.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with Chingooo services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. This includes using secure servers, encryption (where appropriate), and strict access controls. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Chingooo is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 18, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy within the Chingooo App or through other appropriate communication channels. Your continued use of Chingooo after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
